# co-living-DB

## Overview
A co-living is a residential community living model that accommodates people living in the same dwelling unit, facilitated by a professional host. Co-living contributes to a lifestyle concentrated around an international community that provides shared housing for people with similar values or intentions.
While people can create co-living situations on their own, businesses that facilitate the relationship provide some benefits. The main one is that they remove the burdens of doing it on your own, such as negotiating your own contract, furnishing the place and setting up utilities, Wi-Fi and other services. Co-living businesses take care of all of these factors and make it easy to move right in.
Running a co-living business is similar to a hotel business in some ways, such as providing great service. In order to do that, the management team needs to have access to an easy-to-use tool to supervise their co-living business.

We develop a database capable of storing all the informations needed to manage a co-living and to experience a great co-living experience.
A full documentation of the conceptual and logical design of the database can be found in the [docs](docs) folder, as well as the physical implementation of the database in the [src](src) folder.
